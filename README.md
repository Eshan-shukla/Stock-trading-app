This simple stock brokering app allows users to view real-time stock quotes and convert prices to their preferred currency. The app uses two REST APIs to retrieve stock prices and exchange rates, as well as two JSON files to store the latest stock price information. When the user clicks on the buy or sell button, the app edits the local JSON file to reflect the transaction.
